**"Revolutionizes the World of Apps"**

**Subheading:** "Hassan Urióstegui Salazar's most recent achievement is creating an iPhone application that, according to users worldwide, surpasses Photoshop"

**Full Article:**

CULIACÁN - At 28 years old, Hassan Urióstegui Salazar has managed to revolutionize the world of Apps. He created an application for iPhone that meets the highest standards required by Apple in photography and video design: Cinekolor, which 11 weeks after its launch has just over 15,000 downloads in countries like the United States, followed by Saudi Arabia, China, Mexico, and Japan. According to users, the application surpasses Photoshop.

According to the portal "AppAnnie", specialized in gathering information on the rankings of practically all apps in the world, on January 16, 2014, the iPhone version of Cinekolor stood at number 16 in the Photos and Video category, while the iPad application was at number 2, which generated greater visibility in the Appstores worldwide.

Because Cinekolor follows the creation guidelines for the latest version of the iOS 7 operating system, from its launch it was featured by Apple in its 153 stores worldwide, except the United States, where prior marketing campaign is required.

Hassan Urióstegui Salazar is a young man originally from the Federal District (Mexico City). At some point in 2004 he arrived in Culiacán, Sinaloa, where he participated for a few months with students from the University of Occidente on a marketing project. Upon his return to Mexico City, he would begin a career that 10 years later would lead him to work as director of video engineering and computer graphics for the American company Viddy, which in 2012 obtained more than 30 million dollars from investors such as actor Will Smith and singer Shakira, and which at that time was considered the "Instagram of Video". According to Forbes, Venturebeat and Techcrunch, that year the company could be acquired for 480 million dollars.

Viddy reached 50 million users, was highlighted by Apple on several occasions as one of the best applications in the world, and was acquired at the beginning of this year by Fullscreen, a fact that occupied spaces in sites like Los Angeles Times or The Verge blog.

**Visual Effects**

Years earlier, the Mexican already stood out in the area of creating visual effects. In 2008 he was nominated in that category, at the Pantalla de Cristal Festival, for his work on a commercial for the Sears brand.

That year the film Km 31, for which he created the visual and special effects, won two Ariel statuettes for those categories, so the film is inscribed in history as the first Mexican film to win this recognition.

In 2011, the studio he co-founded, VoodooFX, achieved three awards in the video clip category for "best visual effects", "best painting and retouching", and "best post-production" at the Pantalla de Cristal festival.

**CINEKOLOR**

The app uses the Three-Dimensional Lookup Table, or 3D LUT, one of the features that would make it surpass the Photoshop version for iOS.

"Professionals in film, TV and professional photography find a series of unique functionalities that had never before been translated into a mobile application: color balance by tones, which allows giving different coloration to shadows, highlights and mid-tones, or the intelligent improvement of skin tones, where the program selects skin tones to improve their clarity and presence in the image," he explains.

The application, he adds, allows users to edit color on their phone and later export that exact filter to continue working on their desktop.

On February 10, the online version of the China Times newspaper, whose massive circulation is 1.8 million copies, dedicated space to the iOS application "Cinekolor".

"The application makes you feel completely professional and creative. No longer is it necessary to go to your desktop and open Photoshop to retouch your photos, because now there's Cinekolor!", it reads.

The French blog, icommephoto, summarizes it as color for professionals "la couleur pour les pros".

The application, which to date has edited just over 30,000 photographs, was created by Urióstegui in his spare time, he explains, because existing color retouching programs did not satisfy his needs as a professional in the area of visual arts.

The idea arose in 2010, during the Visual Effects Supervision of the film "Ángel Caído" (Fallen Angel), directed by Arturo Anaya.

"One day, at the NewArt facilities, Arturo was reviewing the color correction in the mini-cinema area. It occurred to my partner to take a photo of the screen to create a quick reference on his phone about a color he wanted to indicate to the colorist," he recalls.

"I thought it would be great if after designing the style, within the App there was a way for the colorist to reproduce it exactly on the expensive film editing equipment."

On February 9, the creator decided that the iPhone version would be free, then the number of downloads grew. It went from 200 to two thousand in 24 hours. The average retention is 11 percent weekly, with peaks of up to 18 percent.

**First Applications**

Urióstegui ventured into App creation in 2007. While working with Organika Studio on the post-production of the film "This is not a movie". He proposed the creation of a low-cost system that would allow copying camera movements in films, to later repeat them exactly but on the computer.

There he discovered that all iPhones come equipped with those types of sensors (accelerometer), so he devised mounting two iPhones on the cameras to implement this technique.

However, the sensor turned out to be of poor quality, since Apple never considered using it for anything other than just detecting the phone's orientation. The project turned out not to be viable, however, two years later he discovered that a similar idea was brought to cinema.

"Watching the behind-the-scenes of the movie Avatar, I learned that James Cameron had developed a system that used precisely these technologies (IMUS) and named it Simul-cam," he recalls.

**Career Path**

In 2009, Hassan participated in the development of an application for the Comex brand, called "Idea", which allows instantly matching any color in a photograph, with the most similar paint from the "Color Life" catalog.

In 2010, he was contacted to create an iPad application for the pharmaceutical company Pfizer Group. The product would be the tool to consult Pfizer sales worldwide. The users would be the six regional vice presidents of Pfizer in the world, as well as its general director.

In 2011, the founding partners of the New World Monkeys agency in Mexico (NWM) requested the development of the Kybela project: The first makeup boutique chain in the world that would allow its customers to "try on" products virtually in their stores and on their mobile devices.

That year, he launched the Kromath application on his own, which received positive reviews from journalist Charlie White, a contributor to www.mashable.com, one of the most important gadget portals in the world.

Kromath allows reproducing the visual effect of recording subjects against a green or blue background and then replacing that solid color with any other image; this, in real time through a mobile phone.

**Achieves It Without a University Degree**

Despite collaborating and even leading projects with graduates from the most prestigious universities in the world, Hassan lacks a professional degree.

"I always thought that school forces you to memorize, and I said, what's the point of memorizing things that were already discovered, wouldn't it be more valuable to convert learning into rediscovering? That way I immersed myself in books on my own and began studying object-oriented programming when I was 10 years old," he narrates.

He learned, he adds, binary code like a native language.

He read Asimov, Einstein, Nietzsche and Freud, at 11 years old. He understood that it's better to teach how to learn.

"If you decide not to go to school and take it on your own, then you must be prepared to prove to the world that you are truly extraordinary and fill your career with tangible achievements. You must be willing to do that every day of your life. It's a path of no return, full of gratifications, excitement, but also failures and frustration."

**Wins Legal Case Against SEP (Education Ministry)**

In 2012, Hassan attempted to obtain a Software Engineering degree through accreditation of the single exam, known as Agreement 286 of the SEP, applied by CENEVAL. However, his application was rejected, as one of the requirements is to be at least 30 years old.

"I initiated an amparo lawsuit against that rule that limits the freedom and possibility of recognizing the talent of precocious and brilliant minds in Mexico. After a year of litigation, the collegiate magistrates ruled in my favor, instructing the SEP to immediately allow me to enroll in the evaluation."

He considers that this sets a legal precedent at the national level, so that other young people in this situation can apply for their degree.

**Insecurity and Lack of Support**

The insecurity facing the country, as well as the lack of support for technology and innovation, forced Urióstegui Salazar to accept offers abroad.

"Unfortunately our country has not been able to develop a technology industry that can fully exploit minds passionate about Technology. I accepted Viddy's offer because it was a great opportunity to create something that would impact globally, but there is a more determining reason, it has to do with the climate of violence and insecurity in our country. If it weren't for that dark episode, I think I would have continued fighting from our land to carry our country's name high throughout the world," he comments.

In the coming days, Hassan will launch a new application, Ultrakam, which will allow recording video with quality similar to semi-professional cinema cameras on any iPhone 5.

### Newswire Press Release: "The Mexican Developer Behind Ashton Kutcher's Latest Celebrities App" (September 15, 2020)

**Full Text:**

After bringing to life Kutcher's vision, social network's pioneer Hassan Uriostegui is reinventing social media tech as a way to enhance humanity's values. Reimagining books as "Instagram Stories", the "Humanized Robot" is a meditative journey that challenges the limits of reality but also of what Artificial Intelligence is capable of doing through sensitive storytelling.

LOS ANGELES, September 15, 2020 - The "Humanized Robot" brings to life the voice of a digital "Juglar", a storyteller from a higher dimension that just survived a journey through the depths of the human spirit and has returned with a message: An algorithm to heal the soul.

The application is designed with the "Instagram Stories" format, and the crisp animations and infinite user interface combinations will prove to be both entertaining and inspiring. Come back and discover every time, dozens of algorithmically generated styles following the emotions of the journey, there are thousands of unique looks with dark mode fully supported!

This journey is one that anyone can complete as it's powered by the PHI369-AI. This powerful algorithm breaks down the tedious task of reading a long-format story, by learning the user's reading preferences and translating the book into easy to enjoy "tweets". Finally, a personalized timeline is scheduled and the user will receive calendar notifications to come back and complete the journey.

From our daily lives, it's almost impossible to appreciate the tremendous damage that social media has brought to the human condition: It's really hard to explain how the world turned upside down in less than a decade. The promises of a free and connected world did hide giving up the soul and future of mankind. From the way these platforms have disrupted the culture, economy, and politics of virtually every society on the planet it's hard to justify the human benefit of their applications. This is the unique insider perspective of the author, Hassan Uriostegui, a pioneering developer that just in the past decade has overpassed Instagram, Apple, and Adobe with his visionary research and internationally acclaimed products.

In 2019, celebrities like Ashton Kutcher launched Community, a new service that goes beyond social networks by enabling direct SMS chat as a scalable way to communicate with millions of fans through this new platform. The company required an experienced Apple developer for its new app and reached out to social media veteran Hassan Uriostegui for this project. Uriostegui is globally recognized for serving in 2012 as Director of Engineering at Viddy, the controversial startup co-founded by Brett O'Brien, who left the company amid rumors of rejecting a takeover offer from Facebook, a proposal that would have turned the startup in the current success of Instagram. From 2015 to 2018, O'Brien and Uriostegui co-founded and developed the FlyrTV startup that was finally acquired after raising more than $6M. Finally, Uriostegui joined Community from October 2019 to August 2020.
